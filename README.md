# Sleep, Health & Lifestyle - Machine Learning Project

## Project Description

### Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp Project

This project applies machine learning techniques to evaluate sleep health and lifestyle factors, predicting stress levels based on a range of features, including sleep duration, physical activity, and daily habits. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights that can enhance personal health management by identifying patterns and making data-driven predictions.

### Mission
To leverage machine learning models for optimizing stress level predictions. By using comprehensive health metrics and lifestyle data, we aim to offer accurate predictions that contribute to improved well-being and personalized recommendations.

### Vision
To set a standard for data-driven health analytics by continuously improving machine learning models. We aim to enable better health decisions and predictive accuracy in wellness management through reliable data and advanced modeling.

## Project Execution Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. **Install Python**: Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Fork the repository on your machine,** and open it locally using Visual Studio Code or similar.
3. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   
```bash
# Create the environment
conda create --name myenv

# Activate the environment
conda activate myenv
```

4. **Install dependencies**: Run this command to install the packages from requirements.txt:

```bash
   conda install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Locate the Data File**: The dataset is located at `data/raw/Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv`.

6. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open `project_main.ipynb`.
   - Ensure that `project_functions.py` is in the same directory.
   - Execute the entire notebook to preprocess the data and train the machine learning models.
