# Sleep, Health & Lifestyle- Machine Learning Proyect
Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp Project

This project applies machine learning techniques to evaluate sleep health and lifestyle factors, predicting outcomes such as stress levels and heart rate based on a range of features, including sleep duration, physical activity, and daily habits. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights that can enhance personal health management by identifying patterns and making data-driven predictions.

Mission
To leverage machine learning models for optimizing sleep health predictions. By using comprehensive health metrics and lifestyle data, we aim to offer accurate predictions that contribute to improved well-being and personalized recommendations.

Vision
To set a standard for data-driven health analytics by continuously improving machine learning models. We aim to enable better health decisions and predictive accuracy in wellness management through reliable data and advanced modeling.
